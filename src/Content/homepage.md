### What is Cubex?

Cubex is an open source PHP framework designed around performance and simplicity. Cubex act as the glue for some great
PHP packages, aiming to offer a consistent environment making development easier.

### Performance

Cubex is focused on optimising the speed of every request to ensure your code operates as fast as possible.

Cubex is used within many high scale web applications and backends which demand performance to be at its best.

### Simplicity

There is no need to be writing boiler plate code these days. Cubex works to reducing the amount of code required to
produce some amazing results, while supporting developers wishing to push the boundries.

### Fully Tested

All code within cubex aims to have 100% code coverage, and test as many variations of user or developer input as
possible.

Test cases are constantly maintained with new functionality, and we aim to write tests for every bug fixed & found, to
ensure it doesn't ever come back.
